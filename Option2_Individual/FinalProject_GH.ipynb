    "As the coronavirus wreaks havoc on the US' economy, I am wondering if the San Diego Parks and Recreation Department should be granted a higher budget to create better park experiences, and thus help local business attract more customers. I am looking for a correlation between higher budget and better Yelp reviews on local business(specifically hotels and restaurants). While I cannot find any study that directly address this correlation, I do find many benefits that parks can bring to the local economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to WeConserve PA(1), a conservation community based in Pennsylvania, good parks attracts tourists to improve local economy. Homebuyers prefer purchasing properties near parks, which increases government tax income and local population, bringing in more business, further improing the economy. A case study demonstrates the benefits brought by the Balboa Park(2). Conducted by San Diego State University and Balboa Parj Conservancy, the *Balboa Park Benefits Study* concludes that the park alone brings an annual economic impact of 354.6 million dollars, which includes tourist lodging, food, shopping, etc. Moreover, it highlights that these non-local travelers occupy over 300 thousand hotel room nights and brings in 3.2 million dollars in sales tax. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a well-maintained parks system can generate significant economic impacts to the local economy. I am set to observe this impact on a micro scale, which is to find a correlation between the budget of the Parks Department and the reviews of local business on Yelp.\n",
